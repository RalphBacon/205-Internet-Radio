# 205 Internet Radio  
### An Internet Streaming Radio using an ESP32, a VS1053 MP3 decoder, and an ILI6341 TFT touch screen  

### See my YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/xrR8EZh2bMI  
An Internet Radio Player for around $20 (without a case) can't be all bad and you get to build it too!  

#### First order free! 2-sided PCB just $5 for 10 pieces. https://www.pcbway.com

This **Internet Radio** was written from the ground up so that I could learn how it all worked. As a beta version 0.1 I think it's OK to release onto my unsuspecting YouTube viewers!  

Although we don't really go through the code (there's over 900 lines and counting) I do explain the crux of connecting to a streaming radio URL and how we get the data stream - along with  the Artist and Track information, if you want.  

This is a work in progress and even as I write this I have implemented a buffering system to improve playback that I hope to explain in next week's video.
