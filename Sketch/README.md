The sketch was originally written using the **PlatformIO** IDE but will work just fine in the **Arduino IDE** too.

### For Arduino:

### Follow the instructions in the Arduino IDE folder.

### For PlatformIO
This is the complete project, you know what to do to include it into your workspace. (Note, you may need to edit your workspace folder at the same level as your Project's folder) to something like this:
```
"folders": [
		{
			"name": "ESP32 Better Internet Radio",
			"path": "Projects\\ESP32 Better Internet Radio"
		}
	],
  ```
  It will then appear in PlatformIO's workspace list of projects.
